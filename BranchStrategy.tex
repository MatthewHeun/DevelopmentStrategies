This document gives my strategy for branching in a git repository. 
The strategy is based on the fine blog post by Vincent Driessen
and other resources.
Adherence to this strategy will enable better development processes.

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The use of branches can greatly assist software development projects, 
particularly when developers need to both 
work on new features and maintain released code.

This document gives my model for branching in a git repository. 
The strategy is based on the fine blog post by Vincent Driessen~\cite{Driessen:2010}
and other resources~\cite{Onkelinx:2017, Rankin:2010}.
The model assumes the existence of \texttt{github} or a similar remote repository
and use of the RStudio IDE, 
although the model (if not the details) 
will apply to other IDEs that support branching. 

In addition, it can be difficult to remember 
all of the \texttt{git} commands for branching and merging.
This document gathers all commands in a single place
and discusses the commands in the context of the overall workflow.
 
Adherence to this strategy and use of these commands 
will improve my software development processes.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Rules} 
\label{sec:rules}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{enumerate}

  \item The \texttt{master/main} and \texttt{develop} branches are persistant
  
  \item Only one (1) \texttt{release-x.x.x} branch can exist at any given time

  \item Only one (1) \texttt{hotfix-x.x.x} branch can exist at any given time
  
  \item Any number of feature branches can co-exist
  
  \item Releases are retrieved by reverting to tags

\end{enumerate}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Workflows} 
\label{sec:workflows}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The workflows presented here assume familiarity 
with the Driessen branching model~\cite{Driessen:2010}. 
(See attached figure.)
All \texttt{git} commands must be entered 
at the command line of the developer's local computer
in the root directory of the repository.
Both Terminal.app (MacOS) and the Terminal window of RStudio
can be used for this purpose.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Setup} 
\label{sec:setup}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the following workflow to establish a repository and 
create the \texttt{master/main} (release) and \texttt{develop} branches.
%
\begin{enumerate}

  \item Create a git repository

  \item Clone the repository, duplicating the \texttt{master/main} branch on the local computer:
  		\texttt{git clone git@github.com:MatthewHeun/<<RepositoryName>>.git}
  
  \item Create the \texttt{develop} branch: 
  		\texttt{git checkout -b develop master/main}
		
  \item Make an initial push of the \texttt{develop} branch to origin (github):
        \texttt{git push -u origin develop}
		
  \item Future pushes to github from the \texttt{develop} branch 
  		can be made from RStudio's \texttt{git interface}.

  \item If needed, click the refresh icon 
  		(\raisebox{-0.3\height}{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{refresh}}) in the Git pane of RStudio to 
  		show that the project is now on the \texttt{develop} branch.
  
\end{enumerate}

To set up a repository with Zenodo for DOI creation, see 
\url{https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/}

To add a DOI badge to `Readme.md` or `Readme.Rmd`, see
\url{https://gist.github.com/seignovert/ae6771f400ca464d294261f42900823a}


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Develop a feature (\texttt{newfeature})} 
\label{sec:feature}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the following steps to develop a feature.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Switch to develop branch: \texttt{git checkout develop}

  \item Create a feature branch: \texttt{git checkout -b newfeature develop} 
  
  \item Work on the feature
  
  \item Add new features to \texttt{NEWS.md} file as they are developed, but
        don't add a version number or date yet.

  \item Commit changes locally

  \item If \texttt{newfeature} is to be pushed to github, RStudio won't be able to do so until you
  %
  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Make an initial push of the \texttt{newfeature} branch
	      to the origin (github):
		  \texttt{git push -u origin newfeature} 
	
	\item Future pushes to github can be made using the RStudio interface.

  \end{enumerate}
  %
  \item When complete, merge \texttt{newfeature} with the \texttt{develop} branch:
  %
  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Switch to develop branch: \texttt{git checkout develop}

    \item Merge \texttt{newfeature} into develop: \texttt{git merge --no-ff newfeature}
	
	\item Add a commit comment (or accept the default) using \texttt{vi} 
	
	\item Save the comment using \texttt{ZZ} (``save'' in \texttt{vi})

  \end{enumerate}
  %
  \item If needed, click the refresh icon 
		(\raisebox{-0.3\height}{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{refresh}}) to show that the 
		changes have been merged properly.
  
  \item Push changes on \texttt{develop} branch to github
  %
  \item When satisfied, delete \texttt{newfeature} branch
  %
  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Switch to develop branch: \texttt{git checkout develop}

    \item Delete locally: \texttt{git branch -d newfeature}

    \item Delete remote (if necessary): \texttt{git push -d origin newfeature} 
	
	\item Prune from other machines (if necessary): \texttt{git remote prune origin} 

  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item If intending to submit to CRAN, 
        run the following steps.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
	  
    \item \verb+devtools::spell_check()+

	\item \verb+devtools::check_win_release()+

    \item \verb+devtools::check_win_devel()+

    \item \verb+devtools::check_rhub(interactive = FALSE)+

    \item \verb+revdepcheck::revdep_check(num_workers = 4)+
    %
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Note that \texttt{revdepcheck} must be installed from github. 
            See \url{https://github.com/r-lib/revdepcheck}.

	  \item \verb+devtools::install_github("r-lib/revdepcheck")+

    \end{enumerate}
    %

    \item \verb+devtools::release()+ \\
          But don't actually release to CRAN!
            
  \end{enumerate}
  %
\end{enumerate}


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Prepare for release}

  \item If the \texttt{release-x.x.x} branch is to be pushed to github
        (necessary if you want to submit to CRAN), 
        RStudio won't be able to do so until you
  %
  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Commit locally

    \item Make an initial push of the \texttt{release-x.x.x} branch
	      to the origin (github): 
		  \texttt{git push -u origin release-x.x.x} 
	
	\item Future pushes to github can be made using the RStudio interface.

  \end{enumerate}
  %

  %
  \item Commit locally
  
  \item Optionally, push to GitHub

\end{enumerate}
